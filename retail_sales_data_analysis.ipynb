    "# Retail Sales Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will be exploring and analyzing a historical retail sales dataset that details store-level performance, promotional activities, and seasonal effects over a defined period. The dataset includes information on various stores and their departments, featuring records of weekly sales, store characteristics, and a range of contextual factors such as regional conditions, holidays, and markdown events.\n",
    "\n",
    "By examining these data, we aim to gain insights into the relationships between promotional markdowns, holiday-driven consumer behavior, and overall sales outcomes across different stores and departments. This exploratory and analytical work will serve as a foundation for understanding the datasetâ€™s intricacies and will guide subsequent modeling and decision-making processes.\n",

    "The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjeetsingh/retaildataset) on Kaggle.com by Manjeet Singh."
